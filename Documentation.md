# Documentation
In this file i am going to document the process of this project.

## Part A
I created a folder called TOWA and within that folder I created this Angular project with simple commands:

If Angular isn't installed, run this command on the cmd:
```js
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

To create an Angular project run the following command:
```js
ng new towa-app
```

## Part B
After setting up the project, the goal of Part B was to create the header, main & footer.
